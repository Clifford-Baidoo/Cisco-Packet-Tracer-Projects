# Cisco Packet Tracer Projects

**A collection of Cisco Packet Tracer simulations for networking labs and projects.**

## About This Repository

This repository contains my Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) files and related documentation for various networking projects and labs. These simulations cover key CCNA-level (and beyond) concepts such as VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, DNS, routing protocols (RIP, OSPF), NAT, server services (Email, FTP, HTTP), and multi-site connectivity.

The projects are designed to demonstrate real-world network scenarios, including campus networks, branch connectivity, and external service access.

## Current Project

### School Network Simulation (Main Project)

A complete multi-site school network with two campuses:

- **Main Campus**: 3 buildings, 8 VLANs, central multilayer switch (inter-VLAN routing + DHCP), access switches
- **Branch Campus**: Separate multilayer switch and devices
- **Services**:
  - Internal DNS, FTP, and Web servers
  - External-like Email server (via Cloud-PT simulation)
- **Routing**: RIP version 2 for dynamic inter-site connectivity
- **Features**: VLAN segmentation, NAT, static/dynamic routing, server configuration

## Future Projects (Planned)
- OSPF multi-area design
- ACL and security implementation
- VPN site-to-site simulation
- Wireless LAN with controller
- IPv6 integration

## Requirements
- Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.2 or later recommended)

## How to Use
1. Download the desired `.pkt` file.
2. Open in Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Explore configurations, test connectivity, and modify as needed for learning.
